    <!-- 1. Cardiac Cycle -->
    <string name="cardiac_cycle1">
        Cardiac Cycle\n\n
        The cardiac cycle is the rhythmic muscular contractions of the heart through systole and diastole of both the atria nad ventricles.\n
        Each phase of the cycle can be represented by waves on an electrocardiogram and consists of seven distinct phases:\n\n
        1. Atrial contraction\n
        2. Isovolumetric contraction\n
        3. Rapid ejection\n
        4. Reduced ejection\n
        5. Isovolumetric relaxation\n
        6. Rapid filling\n
        7. Reduced filling\n\n

        The diagram below shows the cardiac cycle.

    <string name="s1">
        <b>The first heart sound “lub”</b>\n
        &#8226; The closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves in early ventricular systole\n
        &#8226; Normally heard as a single sound due to the simultaneous closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves\n
        &#8226; Mostly hear the closure the mitral valve\n
        &#8226; High frequency sound caused by vibrations of the valves and walls of the heart\n\n
        <b>M1:</b>\n
        &#8226; The sound produced by the closure of the mitral valve\n
        &#8226; Can be heard the loudest at the mitral area at the apex\n
        &#8226; Main component of S1\n\n
        <b>T1:</b>\n
        &#8226; The sound produced by the closure of the tricuspid valve\n

        <b>The second heart sound “dub”</b>\n
        &#8226; Produced by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves\n
        &#8226; High frequency sound\n
        &#8226; Pulmonic closure: Best heard in the 2nd/3rd intercostals space left sternal border\n
        &#8226; Aortic closure: Best heard in the 2nd/3rd intercostals space right sternal border\n\n
        <b>Expiration</b>\n

        <b>The Third Heart Sound – S3 – Ventricular Gallop</b>\n
        &#8226; Abnormal heart sound that occurs at the end of the passive filling phase\n
        &#8226; Best be heard as a dull, low pitched noise immediately following S2\n
        &#8226; Can be difficult to distinguish from a split S2\n
        &#8226; If the sound heard at the tricuspid area: The right ventricle is faulty\n
        &#8226; If the sound occurs at the mitral area: The left ventricle is faulty\n
        &#8226; A pathological S3: Ventricular gallop\n\n
        <b>Can be a normal heart sound</b>\n

    <string name="s4">
        <b>The Forth Heart Sound – S4 – Atrial Gallop</b>\n
        &#8226; Abnormal heart sound known as the pre-systolic gallop\n
        &#8226; Occurs shortly before the next S1\n
        &#8226; Distinguishing an S3 from an S4 can be challenging\n
        &#8226; Can be heard in late diastole\n
        &#8226; Caused by the vibration of the ventricular wall during atrial contraction\n
        &#8226; Sound is produced by the atrium forcefully contracting against a stiffened ventricle\n
        &#8226; A dull and low pitched sound\n\n
        <b>Summation gallop</b>\n
        &#8226; If a patient with both S3 and S4 develops tachycardia, diastole is shorted and the sounds become very close together\n

    <string name="aorticstenosis1">
        <b>Aortic Stenosis-Left Lower Sternal Border</b>\n\n
        &#8226; The intensity and timing of the murmur correlate with severity\n
        &#8226; As murmurs that are very harsh and peak later in systole, closer to S2, signal severe obstruction\n\n
        <b>Etiology</b>\n
        &#8226; Most common cause is age-related calcification of the aortic valve\n
        &#8226; Less common causes include calcification of congenital bicuspid aortic valves and rheumatic heart disease.\n
        &#8226; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other rare congenital disorders can obstruct the left ventricular outflow tract without affecting the AV\n\n
        <b>Presentation</b>\n
        &#8226; Most common is fatigue and dyspnea.\n
        &#8226; As AS worsens, patients develop syncope, angina, and heart failure\n\n
        <b>Where to listen</b>\n
        &#8226; RUSB with the diaphragm; listen for radiation to the carotid arteries\n
        &#8226; Occasionally audible at LLSB and apex\n

    <string name="mitralregurgitation1">
        <b>Mitral Regurgitation – Apical Lift</b>\n
        &#8226; Typically mitral regurgitant flow persists through all of systole.\n
        &#8226; Mitral regurgitant reflects the driving force of the pressure difference between the left ventricle and atrium\n\n
        <b>Etiology</b>\n
        &#8226; Most common causes are ischemia, LV dilatation from any cause, and degenerative calcification of the MV.\n
        &#8226; Less common causes include rheumatic heart disease, congenital malformation of valve, infective endocarditis, trauma, and mitral valve prolaspse\n\n
        <b>Where to listen</b>\n
        &#8226; Loudest in apex with radiation to the axilla\n
        &#8226; Sound increases with handgrip, which increases afterload\n
    </string>
    <string name="aorticregurgitation1">
        <b>Aortic Regurgitation – Left Lower Sternal Border</b>\n
        &#8226; A widened pulse pressure (increased systolic BP and decreased diastolic BP) often accompanies AR\n
        &#8226; The decrease in the diastolic pressure is a good indicator of severity\n\n
        <b>Etiologies of AV disease and aortic root disease</b>\n
        &#8226; The most common valvular cause is rheumatic heart disease, with infective endocarditis, congenital bicuspid aortic valves\n
        &#8226; Less common causes is trauma\n
        &#8226; Marked dilatation of the aortic root is associated with Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfect, tertiary syphilis, ankylosing spondylitis, and severe uncontrolled hypertension\n
        &#8226; Aortic root dilatation can occur with a bicuspid aortic valve even in the absence of any significant AS or AR\n\n
        <b>Where to listen</b>\n
        &#8226; In disease of the aortic valve, the diastolic AR murmur (DM) is best heard at the left mid-sternal border (~4th intercostal space) with the diaphragm; patient leaning forward; held expiration\n
        &#8226; In disease of the aortic root (less common), the murmur is best heard at the RUSB\n
        &#8226; The diastolic AR murmur (DM) is often coincident with 2 other murmurs\n
        &#8226; In total, three murmurs are possible:\n
        <t>1. A mid-systolic ejection murmur (SM) audible at the LLSB and apex</t>\n
        <t>2. A double-component Austin Flint murmur at the apex</t>\n
        <t>t3. The diastolic AR murmur (DM)</t>\n
        &#8226; Sound increases with handgrip/squat and decreases with valsalva\n
        &#8226; Classic AR valve disease:\n
        <t>&#8226; Left mid-sternal border: AR diastolic murmur +</t>\n
        <t>&#8226; LLSB: Mid-systolic ejection murmur ±</t>\n
        <t>&#8226; Apex: Austin Flint murmur +, mid-systolic ejection murmur</t>\n
        &#8226; Aortic root disease can be heard at RUSB\n

    <string name="mitralstenosis1">
        <b>Mitral Stenosis – Left Upper Sternal Border</b>\n
        &#8226; MS is associated with pulmonary hypertension and can produce jugular venous distention with giant α waves\n
        &#8226; To differentiate the MS rumble from the Austin Flint murmur, since both are heard at the apex\n
        &#8226; The S1 is not loud with the Austin Flint murmur\n
        &#8226; The Austin Flint murmur has 2 components to the diastolic rumblings (“fro-fro” cadence)\n
        &#8226; In true AR, the AR diastolic murmur is audible at the LLSB (valve disease) or the RUSB (root disease), in addition to the apical Austin Flint murmur\n
        &#8226; Mitral stenosis is not associated with murmurs audible at the LLSB or RUSB, but an opening snap may be heard there\n\n
        <b>Etiology</b>\n
        &#8226; Almost exclusively, MS is a consequence of rheumatic heard disease\n
        &#8226; Congenital malformations of the MV are rare\n\n
        <b>Where to listen</b>\n
        &#8226; Apex only; best heard with bell in left lateral decubitus position\n
        &#8226; Opening snap (OS) audible in many listening areas, such as at the LUSB in this example\n
        &#8226; Murmur is louder with exercise and tachycardia\n
        &#8226; Easily missed\n
        &#8226; The opening snap is a tip-off\n
